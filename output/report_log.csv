Total should equal Scope 1 + Scope 2 (location-based) + Scope 3. | [WARNING] scope3_emissions: Scope 3 represents only 37.5% of total emissions | Recommendation: Scope 3 typically represents 70-90% of total emissions. Review calculation methodology, especially Categories 1, 3, 4, and 11. Consider using GHG Protocol Scope 3 Evaluator tool. | [WARNING] narrative_disclosures: No narrative disclosures provided | Recommendation: CSRD requires extensive narrative disclosures. Prepare descriptions for: transition plans, governance, strategy integration, stakeholder engagement, and double materiality assessment process. | [SUGGESTION] total_emissions: Emissions value appears to be rounded to nearest thousand | Recommendation: Consider reporting with appropriate precision (1-2 decimal places) to demonstrate calculation rigor. | [SUGGESTION] water_efficiency: Low water consumption ratio (20.0%) | Recommendation: High discharge rate may indicate opportunities for water recycling.
