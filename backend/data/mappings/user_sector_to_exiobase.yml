# User Sector to EXIOBASE Mapping Configuration
# ==============================================
# Maps user-friendly sector labels to EXIOBASE 3 sector names.
# Used by app/services/exiobase_mapping.py for spend-based calculations.
#
# Format:
#   "user_label": "EXIOBASE_sector_name"
#
# The EXIOBASE sector names must exactly match activity_type values
# in the emission_factors table where dataset = 'EXIOBASE_2020'.
#
# NOTE: EXIOBASE sectors often include NACE codes in parentheses.
#       These must be included for exact matching.
#
# Adding new mappings:
#   1. Query: SELECT DISTINCT activity_type FROM emission_factors WHERE dataset='EXIOBASE_2020'
#   2. Add a user-friendly label that your frontend/users will use
#   3. Test with: python scripts/test_exiobase_e2e.py
